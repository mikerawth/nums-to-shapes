    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sort an array of integers in ascending order</li>
      <li>Integer divisible by 2 is a square</li>
      <li>Integer divisible by 3 is a circle</li>
      <li>Integer divisable by 2 & 3 is a triangle</li>
      <li>Integer is even, shape should be red</li>
      <li>Integer is odd, shape should be green</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sort integers using the array.sort() method</li>
      <li>
        Stating that an integer is divisible by 2 & 3 means that it is divisble
        by 6
      </li>
      <li>
        To produce the correct result, check to see that an integer is divisble
        by 6 before checking an integer is divisble by 2
        <br />
        Checking to see that an integer is divisble by 2 first means that the
        function will never check for an integer divisble by 6
      </li>
      <li>All integers divisible by 2 & 6 will be even and thus red</li>
      <li>All integers divisble by 3, but not 6, will be odd and thus green</li>
      <li>
        Also need to include a shape that is not divisible by 2,3 or 6. This
        includes numbers divisible by 5, 7 and other prime numbers (11, 13,
        etc.).
        <br />
        Since a number divisible by 2 will always be even, numbers that are not
        included in the above criteria will always be odd.
      </li>
    </ul>
